Ingredients

    16 oz frozen chopped broccoli thawed & drained
    1 cup plain bread crumbs
    3 eggs lightly beaten
    6 slices crisp-cooked bacon diced
    2 tsp salt
    2 tsp salt
    2 tsp salt
    2 tsp salt
    2 tsp salt
    2 cups shredded sharp cheddar
    1 cup shredded mozzarella

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
    In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Form patties by making a ball about the size of a golf ball; flatten slightly and place on prepared baking sheet. TIP: An ice cream scoop makes this easy and gives the right sized portion.
    Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes. Turn patties and continue to cook for an additional 10 minutes or until nicely browned.
    Makes about 16 patties.
